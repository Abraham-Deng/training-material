    "In Galaxy, data is stored in datasets and organized in histories",
    "The right pane shows the current history. It displays the name of the history, the tags and annotations assigned to it, and the size of the data in it",
    "The datasets are shown differently depending on their status: queued, running, ok, error, or paused",
    "The summary view for each dataset can be expanded to show additional information",
    "Datasets deleted are hidden from history. They can be restored to the history, or permanently deleted from the server, or purged. Purged files cannot be restored",
    "Histories can also be deleted and purged, similar to datasets",
    "Datasets can be organized into collections within a history with search and multi-select. Jobs applied to collections use the same settings for each dataset in the collection"
