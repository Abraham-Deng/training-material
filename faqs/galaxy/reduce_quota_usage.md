* **Download** Datasets as individual files or entire Histories as an archive. Then *purge* them from the public server.
* **Copy** Datasets or Histories to another Galaxy server, including your own Galaxy. Then purge.
* **Copy** your most important Datasets into a new/other History (inputs, results), then purge the original full History.
* Extract a **Workflow** from the History, then purge it. 
* **Back-up your work**. It is a best practice to download an archive of your FULL original Histories periodically, even those still in use, as a backup.

**Resources** Much discussion about all of the above options can be found at the Galaxy Help forum https://help.galaxyproject.org/
