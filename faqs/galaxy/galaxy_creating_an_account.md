1. To create an account at any public Galaxy instance, choose your server from the available [list of Galaxy Platform](https://galaxyproject.org/use/).
 There are 3 public  Galaxy servers, which are [UseGalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/), [UseGalaxy.org (Main)](https://usegalaxy.org/) and [UseGalaxy.org.au](https://usegalaxy.org.au/).
2. Click on **"Login or Register"** in the masthead on the server.
3. Fill in your **Email and Password** in the spaces provided
4. Click on the **Login** button
5. When logged in, a User menu becomes available that is specific to your account.
6. Wait for your account creation confirmation email and confirm your new account (if it hasn't arrived yet, check your spam folder). It will include an activation link along with an abbreviated terms of service explanation..Â
