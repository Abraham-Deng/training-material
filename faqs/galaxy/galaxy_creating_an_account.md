1. To create an account at any public Galaxy instance, choose your server from the available [list of Galaxy Platform](https://galaxyproject.org/use/).
 There are 3 public  Galaxy servers, which are [UseGalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/), [UseGalaxy.org (Main)](https://usegalaxy.org/) and [UseGalaxy.org.au](https://usegalaxy.org.au/).

3. Click on "Login or Register" in the masthead on the server. When logged in, a User menu becomes available that is specific to your account.

4. Please make sure your registered account email address is valid so you can confirm your new account, and our administrative support team can contact/reply to you when needed. Account email addresses are case sensitive.Â 

5. Wait for your account creation confirmation email (if it hasn't arrived yet, check your spam folder). It will include an activation link along with an abbreviated terms of service explanation.
