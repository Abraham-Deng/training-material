1. To review all active Datasets in your account, go to **User > Datasets**.
2. Logging out of Galaxy while the Upload tool is still loading data can cause uploads to abort. This is most likely to occur when a dataset is loaded by browsing local files.
3. If you have more than one browser window open, each with a different Galaxy History loaded, the Upload tool will load data into the most recently used history.
4. Click on refresh icon {% icon galaxy-refresh %} at the top of the History panel to display the current active History.
