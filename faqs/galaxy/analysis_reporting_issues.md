- For reporting **Usage Problems**, related to tools and functions, head to the [Galaxy Help](https://help.galaxyproject.org/) site.
    - **Red error datasets**:
        - To resolve it you might be asked to send a bug report.
        - Click on the green bug icon within one of the red error datasets to start the submission process 
    - **Green unexpected-result datasets**:
        - To resolve it you may be asked to send in a shared history link and possibly a shared workflow link. 
        - Email our team directly on the private mailing list galaxy-bugs@lists.galaxyproject.org. Include the share link(s) and note the problem dataset numbers involved.
    - **Functionality problems**:
        - Using [Galaxy Biostars](https://galaxyproject.org/support/biostar/) is the best way to get help in most cases.
        - If the problem is more complex, email a description of the problem and how to reproduce it. 
    - **Administrative problems**:
        - If the problem is present in your own Galaxy, the administrative configuration may factor.  
        - For the fastest help directly from the development community, admin issues can be alternatively reported to the mailing list or the GalaxyProject [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby). 

- For **Security Issues**, do not report them via GitHub. Kindly disclose these as explained in this [document](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/SECURITY_POLICY.md).
- For **Bug Reporting**, create a Github issue. Include the steps mentioned [here](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/analysis_troubleshooting_reporting.html).
- Search the [Galaxy Search](https://galaxyproject.org/search/) to find prior Q and A, FAQs, Tutorials, and other documentation across all Galaxy resources, to verify in case your issue was already faced by someone.
