1.Check to see if pop-ups are blocked by your web browser. Where to check can vary by browser and extensions.
2.Double check your API key, if used. Go to **User > Preferences > Manage API key.**
3.Check the sharing/permission status of the Datasets. Go to **Dataset > pencil icon > Edit attributes > Permissions.** If you do not see a "Permissions" tab, then you are not the owner of the data.


Notes:
- If the data was shared with you by someone else from a Shared History, or was copied from a Published History, or you are Sharing or Publishing data, be aware that there are multiple levels of data sharing permissions.
- All data are set to "not shared" by default.
- Global sharing, new/existing history, and new/existing data sharing preferences or status can be modified by you at any time under User > Preferences for data that you own..
- User > Preferences > Make all data private is a "one click" option to unshare ALL data (Datasets, Histories). Review the pop-up details and confirm or deny the action. Note that once confirmed and all data is unshared, the action cannot be "undone" in batch, even by an administer. You will need to re-share data again and/or reset your global sharing preferences as wanted.
