### Get Data: Upload

1. Load by "browsing" for a local file. Best for small [datasets](https://galaxyproject.org/learn/managing-datasets/). Some servers will support load data that is 2 GB or larger.If you are having problems with this method, try FTP.
2. Load using an **HTTP URL** or **FTP URL**.
3. Load a few lines of plain text.
4. Load using FTP. Either line command or with a desktop client.
