# Welcome to Part 2 of the tutorial!! 

We'll start by adding a new folder with it's own README file, which will include a galaxy workflow (file + picture)<br>
For this you can use your own made galaxy workflow + screenshot or you can use the one from the example

1. First we are going to make the the new folder and README.md file<br>
    - Click on the "Add file" and select "Create new file"
    - After the Github_Tutorial/ add: `Workflows/README.md`
    - (This will add the folder Workflows and the file README at once)
    - In this file:<br>
            - Start with a header<br>
            - Write an explanation what is in the folder<br>
            - Add the file link under the explanation<br>
            - Add the picture underneath and make sure it is shown in the README file<br>

> _HINT: You can also link to the files in the example folder of this repository, so you don't have to download anything_

Then you'll get something like this:<br>
