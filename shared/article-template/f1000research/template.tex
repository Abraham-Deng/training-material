% In order to ensure smooth and successful processing of your LaTeX manuscript, please follow these guidelines. Before submitting ensure that your PDF compiles correctly, to avoid delays in processing.
% 
% As you prepare your LaTeX manuscript, please bear in mind the following general guidelines.  
% Keep it simple:
% 
% - Keep your LaTeX files as simple as possible; do not use elaborate local macros or highly customized style files. Preferably, use the template provided for formatting your paper.
% - Preferably prepare only one .tex file. 
% - Do not use external style files or packages, except for f1000styles.sty and those packages already referenced in the main.tex template. If you need additional macros, please keep them simple and include them in the .tex document preamble.
% - Source code should be structured so that all .sty and .bst files called by the main .tex file are in the same directory as the main .tex file.
% - AMS math commands are recommended when inserting math equations into your manuscript.
% - When using URLs in the text these should be incorporated as hyperlinks using the \textbackslash hyperref package and \textbackslash href\{\}\{\} function where possible.
% - References to figures and tables within the manuscript should use \textbackslash autoref\{\}
% 
% References:
% -  Reference management systems provide options for exporting bibliographies as BibTEX files (.bib). This template contains an example of such a file, sample.bib, which can be replaced with your own.
% -  Use only the generic \textbackslash cite\{\} command for referencing in the text (like this [1] and this [2]), not other commands built on special macros. Also, make sure that there is no space between reference keynames within the braces (i.e., \textbackslash cite\{refone,reftwo,refthree\}, not \textbackslash cite\{refone, reftwo, refthree\}).
% \end{itemize}

% Generate a PDF file of your project and submit this alongside a zip file containing all project files (including the source files, style files, and PDF) using our \href{https://f1000research.com/for-authors/publish-your-research}{online submission form}.
