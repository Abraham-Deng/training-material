# Github_Tutorial_Beginner
Github tutorial for working with github for the first time.

---
### Let's Start!

1. First go to [Github.com](https://github.com) and sign up for GitHub or sign in if you already have an account.
2. Click on the (![New_Repository](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42538229/137142260-0070134d-99f3-4ab9-a5df-3a3d799abeca.png)
 in the repository menu in the top left. 
3.	Now Create the repository by using the following settings:
   * Repository name = Github_Tutorial_Beginner
   * Description = Github tutorial for working with github for the first time.
   * Set to Private (so it is only viewable for you, this is changed later)
   * Select “Add a README file”
   * Press the “Create repository” button 

---

Now your almost empty repository is made. The only information inside is the README.md file. This file contains the main information about your study/review/game/tool/or whatever you want in your github. Now it looks something like this:<br>

---

4. Now click on the :pencil2: icon to add the README file.
5. To line 3 add the following: Whoohoo, I'm working in Github for the first time! :grin: <br>
At the bottom in the Commit changes section add the discription: Added my first line! <br>
Now use the Commit changes to change the file.

>These descriptions can help to remember what you've done at a later stage.<br>

Now we can see that our senteance isn't separated by an enter.

So we're going to change the file again!

---

6. To change this we can add an extra enter, so line 3 becomes an empty line or we can place a <'br> (without ') at the end of the senteance. <br>
*For now we will use the extra enter on line 3*

Now we're going to check out some of the Markdown syntax. <br> 
Markdown is a language that can be converted into for example HTML, but is a lot easier to write and read. <br>
The markdown syntax is easy to use and you can find a lot of cheatsheets of it online like this:
