Every 3 months we organise one day dedicated to the GTN community! Thursday, **May 20th** is the next GTN CoFest. We will be working on the training materials, have discussions with the global Galaxy traning community. Do you teach with Galaxy? Want to learn how to add your tutorial to the GTN? New to the community and just want to learn more? Everybody is welcome!

Anyone who would like to contribute, learn how to contribute to the Galaxy Training Material or just catch up with the community is very welcome to join.

We will coordinate via Zoom (drop-in channel we will keep open the whole day) and the [GTN Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby).
