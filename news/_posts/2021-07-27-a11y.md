**Automatic Light/Dark Mode**

Most browsers now support a feature called [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) which lets your browser tell the website whether it prefers a dark theme or a light theme, in order to match your environment and preferences. This is especially common on mobile devices where you might switch your device theme regularly to match your environment.

The GTN has supported alternative themes for a while now, but we have finally combined that with the prefers-color-scheme feature, and now the default GTN theme will automatically match your device's theme, where supported.

**Accessibility Improvements**

One of the community members suggested that we support alternative formats for accessing our JavaScript based slides, as this can be difficult for users using screen readers. We've now added support for "plain text slides", where we render the slide decks as a single long document. The rendering is imperfect, due to how our slide deck library handles custom classes within slides, but it should still be an improvement for anyone who wants to scroll through the slides in an alternative format.
