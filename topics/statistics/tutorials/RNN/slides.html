What is a recurrent neural network (RNN)?

---

# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

- RNN models sequential data (temporal/ordinal)
- In RNN, training example is a sequence, which is presented to RNN one at a time 
	- E.g., sequence of English words is passed to RNN, one at a time 
	- And, RNN generates a sequence of Persian words, one at a time
- In RNN, output of network at time *t* is used as input at time *t+1*
- RNN applied to image description, machine translation, sentiment analysis, etc.
