# Preprocessing with XCMS

The first step of the workflow is the pre-processing of the raw data with **XCMS** ({% cite Smith2006 %}).
{: .text-justify}

**XCMS** {% icon tool %} is a free and open source software dedicated to pre-processing of any type of mass spectrometry acquisition files from low to high resolution, including FT-MS data coupled with different kind of chromatography (liquid or gas). This software is used worldwide by a huge community of specialists in metabolomics using mass spectrometry methods.
{: .text-justify}

This software is based on different algorithms that have been published, and is provided and maintained using R software.
{: .text-justify}

**MSnbase readMSData** {% icon tool %} function, prior to **XCMS**, is able to read files with open format as `mzXML`, `mzML`, `mzData` and `netCDF`, which are independent of the constructors' formats. The **XCMS** package itself is composed of R functions able to extract, filter, align and fill gap, with the possibility to annotate isotopes, adducts and fragments (using the R package CAMERA, {% cite CAMERA %}). This set of functions gives modularity, and thus is particularly well adapted to define workflows, one of the key points of Galaxy.
{: .text-justify}

First step of this tutorial is to download the data test. As describe in the introduction, we will use datas from {% cite VanDerHooft2016 %}. We will only process on a subset of these datas. So, you can **import your files directly in Galaxy by using the following URLs below** or download files into your computer (then upload them on Galaxy) :

```
This step is described as number 1 in details part below.

Then, to be able to process your MS/MS datas, we need to **start with the peakpicking of MS datas**. One Galaxy Training already explains how to process with your MS datas. You should **follow this link and complete this tutorial** : [Mass spectrometry: LC-MS analysis](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/metabolomics/tutorials/lcms/tutorial.html). For MS/MS analysis you **don't really need to finish** this previous tutorial but for a better understanding of your datas, it is recommanded. In this tutorial, you **just have to compute** your datas with the **following steps** briefly describe in the *details* part below (please follow parameters values to have the same results during the training).
{: .text-justify}

> ### {% icon details %} Some help : Resume of the XCMS preprocessing

> >   - **Extraction method for peaks detection** : there are 4 different possible options here. Please select `CentWave - chromatographic peak detection using the centWave method` for our training.
> >   - **Max tolerated ppm m/z deviation in consecutive scans in ppm** : it corresponds to the maximum deviation in ppm. Please set it to `5` for our training.
> >   - **Min, Max peak width in seconds** : it corresponds to the expected approximate peak width in chromatographic space. Please set it to `5,20` in our training to have a large example. 
> > 
> > Here, you have all the right parameters for our example. These are the two dataset collection you will have in your hsitory on the right of Galaxy instance :

> {: .solution}
> 
> > ### {% icon solution %} 4 - *Merge samples*Â in one dataset with a sampleMetadata file
> >
> > To merge your datas, you need to **input a sampleMetadata file** containing namefiles and their metadata informations like their class for example. If you don't add a sampleMetadata file, the **xcms findChromPeaks Merger** {% icon tool %} tool will **group all your files together**. You can also **create your sampleMetadata file** with W4M Galaxy tool **xcms get a sampleMetadata file** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters: *"RData file"* outputed from **MSnbase readMSData** {% icon tool %}. Here is an example of the minimum expectations about a sampleMetadata file (**important** : don't write the format of the file, just their names) :
> > {: .text-justify}

> > |-------------+---------|
> > |    file2    |  femme  |
> > |-------------+---------|
> > |    file3    |  homme  |
> > 
> > You have just to enter the following files in the tool and process it. You should now have these files in your history :
> >   - **Input** : 
> >     - collection of RData object(s) obtained during peak picking (format : `collection.raw.xset.RData`) 
> >     - optionnaly a sampleMetadata file in `tabular` format. For our example please start with `sampleMetadata_hommeVSfemme.csv` in tabular format.
> >   - **Output** : 
> >     - one RData file named `xset.merged.RData` which contains a list of all your datas processed just before.
> {: .solution}
>
> > ### {% icon solution %} 5 - Second XCMS step : *determining shared ions across samples*
> >
> > Open **xcms groupChromPeaks (group)** {% icon tool %} tool and run it with your parameters. This tool will group all your peaks found before together when they represent the same analyte across samples. It uses overlapping m/z bins and calculations of smoothed peak distributions in chromatographic time. In Galaxy instance please set the parameters as below : 
> >  - **Method to use for grouping** : please `keep the PeakDensity method` which will groups peak based on time dimension peak densities.
> >  - **Bandwidth** : it correspond to the standard deviation of the smoothing kernel to be used. Set it to `10` for our example.
> >  - **Minimum fraction of samples** : minimum fraction of samples in at least one sample group in which the peaks have to be present to be considered as a peak group. This value is the threshold and `don't change` it for our example.
> >  - **Minimum number of samples** : minimum number of sample(s) in which the peak have to be detected to be considered as a group. Please `don't change` it for our example.
> >  - **Width of overlapping m/z slices** : the m/z difference between two peaks to be able to be grouped. For our example please set it to `0.05`.
> > 
> > You don't need to change the other parameters, except if you want the peaklist as output. You should now have these files in your history : 
> >  - **Input** : 
> >    - the RData file obtained just before with all datas and peaks informations for each files (format : `xset.merged.RData`).
> >  - **Output** : 
> >    - one Rdata file named `xset.merged.groupChromPeaks.RData` containing all peaks grouped according to their mz and retention time.
> >    - one `pdf` file named `xset.merged.groupChromPeaks.plotChromPeakDensity.pdf`. It contains chromatographic density plots.
> >    - 2 `tsv` files. The first one named `xset.merged.group.dataMatrix.tsv` contains informations about ions intensities. The second one named `xset.merged.group.variableMetadata.tsv` contains an other table with informations about ions. These files are generated only if you set the parameter **Get peaklist** to `yes`. It is just more informations after the grouping step. 
> {: .solution}
>
> > ### {% icon solution %} 6 - Optional XCMS step : *retention time correction*
> >
> > This step is optionnal, it aims to correct retention time drift for each peak among samples. You have to use the **xcms adjustRtime (retcor)** {% icon tool%} tool to correct this retention time. We `don't use it in our example`. But if you will use it during an other processing, you should have these files in your history : 
> >  - **Input** : 
> >    - the Rdata file already with peaks grouped and named `xset.merged.groupChromPeaks.RData`
> >  - **Output** : 
> >    - new RData file named `xset.merged.groupChromPeaks.adjustRtime.RData` with correction of retention time
> >    - one `pdf` file named `xset.merged.groupChromPeaks_rawVSadjusted.adjustRtime.Rplots.pdf`  and containing a plot to show the difference between rt and adjusted rt for each file.
> >    
> > > ### {% icon comment %} Important : Have to group again !
> > >
> > > Retention time have been modified. Consequently, it requires to complete it with an additionnal grouping step with **xcms groupChromPeaks (group)** {% icon tool%}. You will obtain a new Rdata file named `xset.merged.groupChromPeaks.adjustRtime.groupChromPeaks.RData`
> >    {: .warning}
> {: .solution}
>
> > ### {% icon solution %} 7 - Final XCMS step *integrating areas of missing peaks*
> >
> > This last step can be run after grouping your peaks and don't need the retention time correction. Run **xcms fillChromPeaks (fillPeaks)** {% icon tool%} to identify, for each sample, peak groups where that sample is not represented. 
> >  - **Input** : 
> >    - your Rdata file `xset.merged.groupChromPeaks.*.RData`
> >  - **Output** :

> {: .solution}
> > ### {% icon comment %} Important : Be careful of the file format

> > During each step of preprocessing, your file has its format changed and can have also its name changed.
> > To be able to continue to MSMS processing, you need to have a RData object wich is **merged and grouped** (step 4 and 5) at least. It means that you should have a file named `xset.merged.groupChromPeaks.RData` (and maybe with some step more in it).

# Stopover : Verify your datas after the XCMS preprocessing

When you have process **all or only needed** steps described before, you can continue with the MS/MS processing part with **msPurity** package. Don't forget to always check your files format ! For the next step you need to have this file `xset.merged.groupChromPeaks.*.RData` where * is the name of **optionnal** steps you could do during the pre-processing. For our example, your file should be named `xset.merged.groupchromPeaks.RData`. 
{: .text-justify}

> ### {% icon comment %} Comment
> 
> The preprocessing part of this analysis can be **quite time-consuming**, and already corresponds to quite a few number of steps, depending of your analysis. We highly recommend, at this step of the MS/MS workflow, to split your analysis by beginning a new Galaxy history with **only the files you need** (final xset Rdata file and your data collection of mzML). This will help you in limiting selecting the wrong dataset in further analysis, and bring a little **tidiness** for future review of your MS/MS analysis process. You should also be able to make a better peakpicking in the future in the same history and it will not be polluated by MS/MS part of your process.

> To begin a new history with the files from your current history, you can **use the functionality âcopy datasetâ** and copy it into a new history (the option is hidden behind the notched wheel at the top right of the history).
> {: .text-justify}
> 
> You may have notice that the XCMS tools generate **output names that contain the different XCMS steps you used**, allowing easy traceability while browsing your history. Hence, we highly recommend you to rename it **with something short**, e.g. "xset", "XCMSSetObject", or anything not too long that you may find convenient.

> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
> > 
> > During each step of XCMS preprocessing, the name of the file which is processing is completed by the name of the step you were doing. So, finally your file should be name `xset.merged.groupChromPeaks.fillChromPeaks.RData`. That because (as seen in previous answer) you ran a grouping and the integration after merged datas.
