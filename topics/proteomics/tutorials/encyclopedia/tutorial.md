# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

<!-- This is a comment. -->

Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) is a fairly novel technique that can provide useful quantitative information that its counterpart, Data Dependent Aquisition (DDA), often cannot. As will be described in the following tutorial, DIA results in more complicated and multiplexed data compared to DDA. Therefore, with the rise of this new technique, rises a need for new and robust methods of data analysis. 

The workflow described in this tutorial contains three major steps. First is conversion of the input data files from raw file-types to mzML file-types with msconvert. Second is generation of a Chromatogram Library; Chromatogram Library generation offers an alternative to the use of DDA generated libraries for the analysis of DIA data. Lastly is the analysis of DIA data using EncyclopeDIA, a tool generated by Brian Searle {% cite Searle2020 %} {% cite PinoLK2020 %}. DIA analysis with EncyclopeDIA occurs as the experimental DIA data is searched against the generated Chromatogram Library, as well as the background proteome FASTA file. EncyclopeDIA generates peptide and protein quantitation ouputs. Given that all tools used in this tutorial have been uploaded and tested on the GalaxyEU platform, data analysis is made easier than using command based tools. 

**An Overview of the EncyclopeDIA Standard Workflow:**

![Alternative text](../../images/EncyclopeDIA_Workflow_LTR.png)

In this tutorial, we will be using __ sample data acquired by ___ method by ___. 

General introduction about the topic and then an introduction of the
tutorial (the questions and the objectives). It is nice also to have a
scheme to sum up the pipelhhine used during the tutorial. The idea is to
give to trainees insight into the content of the tutorial and the (theoretical
and technical) key concepts they will learn.

You may want to cite some publications; this can be done by adding citations to the
bibliography file (`tutorial.bib` file next to your `tutorial.md` file). These citations
must be in bibtex format. If you have the DOI for the paper you wish to cite, you can
get the corresponding bibtex entry using [doi2bib.org](https://doi2bib.org).

With the example you will find in the `tutorial.bib` file, you can add a citation to
this article here in your tutorial like this:
{% raw %} `{% cite FernandezCosta2020 %}`{% endraw %}.
This will be rendered like this: {% cite Batut2018 %}, and links to a
[bibliography section](#bibliography) which will automatically be created at the end of the
tutorial.

# DDA, DIA, and their differences 

Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) is a novel technique for the analysis of proteomic data samples and is a promising alternative to Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) which has been traditionally used. 

DDA is a method in which specific precursor ions are selected for fragmentation based on their measured abundance in MS1 (Figure 1) . Once selected, MS2 data is collected for these m/z time points and used to determine the sequences of the peptides that are present. Additionally, when integrated with the information given with the precursor peak, the quantity of peptide can be further calculated.

![Alternative text](../../images/EncyclopeDIA_Figure1.png)

On the other hand, DIA selects for multiple ion fragments within a specified m/z range (Figure 2). Compared to DDA that selects for a specific time point corresponding to a specific peptide, DIA scans across a time range resulting in multiplexed and complex MS2 data containing peak information from multiple peptides. 

![Alternative text](../../images/EncyclopeDIA_Figure2.png)

## What does a typical DIA experiment look like?

In a typical DIA experiment, the precursor scan usually ranges between 400-1000 m/z as opposed to 400-1600 m/z typically associated with DDA experiments. Multiple precursor scans are taken, each containing several fragment scans spanning across the entire 400-1000 m/z range (Figure 3A). Specific corresponding fragment ion scans can then be condensed and each combined fragment ion scan containing a small m/z range  and its peaks can be examined and its peptide content can then be analyzed (Figure 3B). 

![Alternative text](../../images/EncyclopeDIA_Figure3.png)

> ### {% icon details %} Advantages of DIA over DDA
>
> An advantage of DIA compared to DDA is that it is possible to obtain a better idea of peptide composition within a sample. Because DDA focuses on single peptides with high abundance indicated by their precursor peaks, this means that less abundant (but perhaps equally interesting or important) peptides are not examined. Therefore, DIA can provide a more comprehensive idea of peptide content within a sample because instead of selecting for fragment ions based on abundance, they are selected within a range. Another advantage to DIA compared to DDA is related to interference from coeluting peptides. Because DDA focuses on a single time point with a single peptide, coelution of another peptide can negatively impact the ability for quantitation. DIA, in contrast, examines multiple peptides through a range of m/z values. Therefore, if interference through coelution threatens the fidelity of a specific peptide, this peptide can be discarded and quantitation can continue with the other peptides within this m/z range. Finally, in cases in which peptides do not emit a precursor signal, DDA is not sufficient to examine these peptides, as their m/z time point will never be chosen based on their lack of abundance in MS1. Because DDA selects for a range of m/z time points, peptides that lack a precursor signal can still be included for further analysis in MS2. For a more detailed description of DIA and its applications and advantages, Brian Searle has given two talks {% cite Introduction to DIA %} {% cite DIA Tips %}.

# Conversion of file types

msconvert is the first tool in this EncyclopeDIA workflow as before analysis of such DIA data may begin, the data files must be converted to the correct file-type (mzML) from the raw data. Conversion from raw to mzML is important because the SearchToLib tool (generation of the Chromatogram Library), as well as the EncyclopeDIA tool (analysis of DIA data) require mzmL inputs. As msconvert exists on the Galaxy platform, conversion of files to the necessary type is straightforward, and can be incorporated into the workflow itself as opposed to a separate precursor. Both the GPF DIA raw data and the Experimental DIA raw data are run through msconvert for conversion to mzML for the following steps, creation of the Chromatogram Library and analysis of DIA data through EncyclopeDIA.

In this workflow, msconvert uses dataset collections. The tool will convert each of the data files in the collection from a raw file-type to a mzML file-type. Then, a dataset collection containing the mzML files will be generated as the output from msconvert. msconvert will run twice, as both the GPF raw DIA data as well as the Experimental DIA raw data need to be converted to mzML file-type. Therefore, two outputs will be generated:

- GPF mzML DIA dataset collection

  This output will serve as an input for SearchToLib in generating the Chromatogram Library.

- Experimental mzML DIA dataset collection

  This output will be the DIA data analyzed with EncyclopeDIA with help from the Chromatogram Library.

# Chromatogram Library Generation

Libraries used in DIA data analysis are often constructed from DDA data assuming that assuming that DDA data is a reasonable substitute or reasonable representation of DIA data, which is not always the case {% cite PinoLK2020 %}. However, researchers began postulating that libraries could be generated using DIA data, and formed methods of generating DIA data libraries as well as libraries generated through other methods. 

As mentioned, there are challenges associated with the use of DDA libraries to analyze DIA data. The main challenge is that the difference in the method of data generation causes inconvenient variance between the DDA library and the DIA data to be analyzed, making accurate investigation of data difficult. One significant difference that arises between DDA libraries and DIA data is retention time. Dependent on how the protein elutes off the column as well as changes caused by coelution in the environment, retention time varies between DDA and DIA methods. Additionally, DDA libraries can be cumbersome to generate when examining DIA data due to differences in methods of fractionation. For example, SCX fractionation provides a vastly different profile compared to high pH reverse phase fractionation. Thus, to generate a comprehensive profile with a DDA library, multiple fractionation methods must be completed. So, while DDA libraries can be used to analyze DIA data, their use significantly increases the required labor and the quantity of data required to generate a library.

Libraries generated using DIA data can bypass several issues, including lowering the overall labor required to produce the library, as well as increasing the accuracy of the library concerning the sample that is being analyzed. To generate libraries using DIA data, Gas Phase Fractionation (GPF) is used. In DDA library generation, typically one injection is performed over the precursor scan, with multiple (24) ion fraction windows contained over the scan. However, using GPF, multiple acquisitions are used for each precursor scan to make up the range of 400-1000 m/z. For example, if six injections are performed over this m/z range, each containing the same number of windows like that of the injection in DDA library generation, then each window will be far smaller (Figure 4). 

![Alternative text](../../images/EncyclopeDIA_Figure4.png)

As shown in Figure 4, GPF and its multiple injections allows for a far richer and more in-depth understanding of the peptide content within the sample making it a useful tool in library generation. In addition to producing a more comprehensive picture of the sample, the GPF method can be used on pooled DIA quantitative samples (Figure 5). Therefore, the pooled sample generates a thorough library through GPF while incorporating a spectrum library to create an “On-column Chromatogram Library” from DIA sample data.

![Alternative text](../../images/EncyclopeDIA_Figure5.png)

SearchToLib is the tool responsible for the generation of the Chromatogram Library in this EncyclopeDIA workflow. A library is generated using the spectral files converted previously, a background protein database in FASTA format, as well as a .dlib spectral library. Outputs from this tool include the Chromatogram Library in an .elib format, as well as a text log file.

> > 1. The benefit to using Chromatogram Libraries compared to DDA generated libraries is largely found in the method of data aquisition. Because Chromatogram Libraries use pooled DIA sample data and use GPF to generate fractions, Chromatogram Libraries are found to be both very comprehensive, as well as very relevant libraries to the experimental samples that are to be analyzed. Additionally, this method also avoids the extra labor associated with performing DDA for just library generation to analyze DIA samples.

The EncyclopeDIA WALNUT workflow and the changed SearchToLib step are described below.

# Analysis of DIA data with EncyclopeDIA Without DLIB Spectral Library

DIA data analysis with EncyclopeDIA is still possible without a Spectral library. Although a Spectral library is a required input for SearchToLib in the Standard EncyclopeDIA workflow, WALNUT (another form of the EncyclopeDIA workflow) can be used. When using the WALNUT workflow, the Background Proteome FASTA file is important, as this will be the primary file SearchToLib will search against in formation of the Chromatogram Library. Otherwise, the WALNUT EncyclopeDIA workflow works similarly to the Standard EncyclopeDIA workflow-- it just does not use a Spectral Library.

Added this image of WALNUT, I was not exactly sure how to convey the slight difference in the workflow without putting the WALNUT and the Standard workflows side by side (which I did not want to do in case it looked cluttered)

>
> However, there are situations in which DIA data is analyzed without the use of DIA data generated libraries (Chromatogram Libraries) or DDA libraries. There are a few different methods and tools that can be used in cases where neither a Chromatogram library nor a DDA library can be generated.
>
> Predicted libraries are being studied in their use in DIA experiments. Specifically, PROSIT is a tool that is used for predicted library generation and it functions by entering peptide sequences through its neural network where it estimates the fragmentation patterns as well as the retention times for the peptide. As PROSIT generates estimates on peptide inputs, it generates a predicted library that can be used in DIA data analysis. This predicted library requires neither DIA sample data nor DDA sample data and is, therefore, a low labor tool in library generation. Predicted libraries are still being studied in their application to DIA data analysis; predicted libraries generally underperform compared to DDA generated libraries; however, these libraries do significantly increase the quality of results compared to forgoing the use of a library altogether. This fact combined with their non-laborious nature means that predicted libraries can be useful in analyzing DIA data.
> 
> In the case in which a predicted library cannot be generated, DIA-Umpire is another tool that is involved in DIA data analysis in which pseudo-spectra are generated. This tool extracts information on coeluting fragment ions that are associated with a specific peptide. This information is used to generate a pseudo-spectrum examining the monoisotopic peak as well as its precursor signals and fragment ions that coelute. Once this information is combined and the pseudo-spectrum is generated with DIA-Umpire, this spectrum can be used relatively normally as if it were a DDA generated library. This method of generating pseudo-spectra is relatively robust; however, it does rely on the ability to detect monoisotopic precursor peaks.

# Analysis of DIA data through EncyclopeDIA

Encyclopedia is the tool used for DIA data analysis through searching peptides against the generated Chromatogram Library. Utilizing the generated Chromatogram library, as well as the experimental DIA data (mzML format), and the background protein database used previously, EncyclopeDIA searches the experimental DIA data against these libraries. Generated are a log .txt file and two quantitation outputs for both proteins and peptides.
