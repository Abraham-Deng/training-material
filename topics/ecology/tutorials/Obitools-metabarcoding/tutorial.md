# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

The data used in this tutorial correspond to those described in the [official OBITools tutorial](https://pythonhosted.org/OBITools/wolves.html) and show how to analyse four wolf scats, using the protocol published in Shehzad et al. (2012) for assessing carnivore diet. After extracting DNA from the faeces, the DNA amplifications were carried out using the primers TTAGATACCCCACTATGC and TAGAACAGGCTCCTCTAG amplifiying the 12S-V5 region (Riaz et al. 2011), together with a wolf blocking oligonucleotide.

# Tutorial based on the official OBITools one
Based on this [OBITools official tutorial](https://pythonhosted.org/OBITools/wolves.html), you will learn here how to analyze DNA metabarcoding data produced on Illumina sequencers using:
 * the OBITools on Galaxy
 * some classical Galaxy tools

The data used in this tutorial correspond to the analysis of four wolf scats, using the protocol published in Shehzad et al. (2012) for assessing carnivore diet. After extracting DNA from the faeces, the DNA amplifications were carried out using the primers TTAGATACCCCACTATGC and TAGAACAGGCTCCTCTAG amplifiying the 12S-V5 region (Riaz et al. 2011), together with a wolf blocking oligonucleotide.

It is always a good idea to have a look at the intermediate results or to evaluate the best parameter for each step. Some commands are designed for that purpose, for example you can use :

- obicount to count the number of sequence records in a file
- obihead and obitail to view the first or last sequence records of a file
- obistat to get some basic statistics (count, mean, standard deviation) on the attributes (key=value combinations) in the header of each sequence record (see The extended OBITools fasta format in the fasta format description)
- any Galaxy tools corresponding to classical unix command such as less, awk, sort, wc to check your files.

# Manage input data
The data needed to run the tutorial are the following:

- fastq files resulting of a GA IIx (Illumina) paired-end (2 x 108 bp) sequencing assay of DNA extracted and amplified from four wolf faeces:
    - wolf_F.fastq
    - wolf_R.fastq
- the file describing the primers and tags used for all samples sequenced:
    - wolf_diet_ngsfilter.txt The tags correspond to short and specific sequences added on the 5â€™ end of each primer to distinguish the different samples
- the file containing the reference database in a fasta format:
    -db_v05_r117.fasta This reference database has been extracted from the release 117 of EMBL using ecoPCR

> ### {% icon question %} Questions
>
> 1. Why do we need to unhide manually datasets from the data collection?
>
> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
> >
> > 1. Data collection is a functionality often used to deal with multiple datasets on the same format who can be analysed in batch mode. Here, the data collection is populated with heterogenous datafiles, coming from an archive. We thus need to treat separately each dataset of the collection, and to do so, we need to unhide corresponding datasets from the history, as datasets insides collections ar "just" like "symbolic link" to "classical" history datasets hidden by default.

# Use OBITools

OBITools is a set of programs specifically designed for analyzing NGS data in a DNA metabarcoding context, taking into account taxonomic information. It is distributed as an open source software available on the following website: http://metabarcoding.org/obitools.

Citation: Boyer F., Mercier C., Bonin A., Taberlet P., Coissac E. (2016) OBITools: [a Unix-inspired software package for DNA metabarcoding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25959493/). Molecular Ecology Resources.

The OBITools commands consider a sequence record as an entity composed of five distinct elements. Two of them are mandatory, the identifier (id) and the DNA or protein sequence itself. The id is a single word composed of characters, digits, and other symbols like dots or underscores excluding spaces. Formally, the ids should be unique within a dataset and should identify each sequence record unambiguously, but only a few OBITools actually rely on this property. The sequence is an ordered set of characters corresponding to nucleotides or amino-acids according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature (Cornish-Bowden 1985). The three other elements composing a sequence record are optional. They consist in a sequence definition, a quality vector, and a set of attributes. The sequence definition is a free text describing the sequence briefly. The quality vector associates a quality score to each nucleotide or amino-acid. Usually this quality score is the result of the base-calling process by the sequencer. The last element is a set of attributes qualifying the sequence, each attribute being described by a key=value pair. The set of attributes is the central concept of the OBITools system. When an OBITools command is run on the sequence records included in a dataset, the result of the computation often consist in the addition of new attributes completing the annotation of each sequence record. This strategy of sequence annotation allows the OBITools to return their results as a new sequence record file that can be used as the input of another OBITools program, ultimately creating complex pipelines.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Recover consensus sequences from overlapping forward and reverse reads.
> 
> When using the result of a paired-end sequencing assay with supposedly overlapping forward and reverse reads, the first step is to recover the assembled sequence.

Based on these two files, the assembly of the forward and reverse reads is done with the illuminapairedend utility that aligns the two reads and returns the reconstructed sequence.

> ### {% icon question %} Questions

> 1. How do you verify the operation is successfull?
> 2. How many sequences are kept? Discarded?
>
> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
> >
> > 1. you can search in the input file content the presence of `mode=joined` and same on the output file (just clicking the eye to visualize the content of each file and typing CTRL+C for example to search `mode=joined` in the file, or using a regex Galaxy tool for example). You can also at least look at the size of the output file, if smaller than input file, this is a first good indication.
> > 2. You can use a Galaxy tool like `Line/Word/Character count of a dataset` to count the number of lines of each dataset (input and output of obigrep) and divided by 4 (as in a FastQ file, each sequence is represented by a block of 4 lines). 45 276 sequences for input file. 44 717 for output file. Thus 559 sequences discarded.

In order to reduce both file size and computations time, and to get easier interpretable results, it is convenient to work with unique sequences instead of reads. To dereplicate such reads into unique sequences, we use the obiuniq command.
