This is not a tutorial like most GTN content but a fun exercise for you to play around and learn a bit about the command line, and hopefully re-inforce the skills you covered in Basic and Advanced CLI skills.

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/interactive_tools_jupyter_terminal.md required=true %}

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl
cd bashcrawl/entrance
# Run: cat scroll
```

Have fun, and good luck!
