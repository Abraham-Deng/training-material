## Introduction

In this tutorial we are going to demonstrate how to find common types of bugs or errors that you may encounter as a contributor to Galaxy.We aim to step you through the process of finding and fixing a bug - from identifying them on GitHub, to finding and developing a solution, to committing your code change.

With the skills from this tutorial, it is our hope that you will feel more prepared to develop solutions for Galaxy and more confidently navigate the obstacles along the way.

## Some Basics

For almost every type of error you encounter, there will be a relatively similar process:

1. View failing test/error on GitHub workflows
2. Run failing test locally
3. Search for issue causing failure
4. Analyze the code, develop and implement a solution
5. Ensure test passes locally
6. Push fixed branch to local fork

Note: This process will not be the same for the runtime error, since there will be no failed test to review initially.

## Getting Started: Pulling the Buggy Fork

Good news! All of the failing tests are on the same fork of Galaxy! That means you only need to download and work off of one branch. The downside is that this is one buggy branch with issues all over the place.

We have no doubts that you can solve them though!

The fork is located at : TODO

### Directions for Cloning/Basing off this fork

TODO

> ### {% icon comment %} Galaxy Repository
>
> Note: This tutorial uses a fork to house the issues created for the purposes of this tutorial. In the future, when you contribute to the Galaxy project, you'll want to use one of the repositories located at https://github.com/galaxyproject. Most likely you'll be using the main repo, simply titled "galaxy".

## Unit Test Failure

We're going to start with our failing unit test.
TODO definition/purpose of tests?

### Finding the failing test on GitHub

If you navigate to TODO you'll see that there are quite a few failing checks. One of them says TODO (check text >)"Unit Test". Feel free to click on that to see a log of all the tests.

Try to identify which test is failing based on the logs.

## API or Integration Test Failure

Next up is the API test.

## Client Linting Failure

Client Linting is important to reduce errors, improve quality of the codebase, and enforce common rules. These rules are defined by the eslinter defined with Vue best practices, primarily. On Github, the command `eslint` is run to start the process for linting code on the client side.

> ### {% icon comment %} Python Linting

> For backend consistency, we also have a python linter. While we won't be running you through that exercise today, you may encounter a python linting issue in the future. The way to diagnose and treat these are very similar to the way to do it for the front end.

### Finding the failing test on GitHub

One of the failing tests on GitHub says "get_code_and_test". Clicking on the word "Details" assocated with this failure will open a brief view of the CircleCI Checks, with a list of tests that are run as part of that command. You'll see that the one that is failing is js_lint. And if you click that, you'll be navigated to the CicleCI app, where you can see much more information about the failures.

Here you can see the exact command that ran to lint our codebase; it's `cd client && yarn run eslint`.

We can also see that it has found 1 error, where the error is and a description of the problem.

### Running the linter locally

Alright, so we've seen the failure, but we want to verify it locally now. For this, you'll need to open up a terminal.

The first thing you'll need to do is activate your virtual environment:

> `. /path_to_galaxy_on_your_machine/.venv/bin/activate`

Then you've got two options. You can run the same exact command that CircleCI uses `cd client && yarn run eslint` or `make client-lint`, which does `cd client && yarn run eslint && yarn run prettier-check`. This will also make sure your code conforms to formatting standards.

After running that, you should see the same linting error from CircleCI; you should know where it is and how to fix it too!

### Finding and Fixing the Issue

> ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>
> In the file `client/src/components/RuleBuilder/RuleComponent`, there is an unused import. Simple delete the line that says `import Vue from "vue";` {: .solution }

If you think you've got it, try running the test locally again to be sure.

### Finishing up

Whoo-hoo! If you're here, you've found the problem, ran it locally, fixed the problem, ran it locally again without errors, and are ready to commit your change. Write a descriptive commit message like `fixed a client linting issue in RuleComponent` or whatever you like, as long as it's clear what you've done.

Awesome work - you now understand how to solve client linting issues!

## Client Test Failure

Client tests are tests written by developers to test front-end code. In the case of the test we're going to walk through right now, we're looking at a Vue test failure, which means the component that it's testing is definitely a Vue component.

### Finding the failing test on GitHub

One of the failing tests on GitHub says "Client Unit Testing / jest". Clicking on Details beside that failure, will open up a the terminal output from that test. Here you should be able to see what test is failing.

> ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>
> The failing test file is `src/components/RuleBuilder/SavedRulesSelector.test.js`, and the failing test in that file is `SavedRulesSelector â€º disables history icon if there is no history`. {: .solution }

### Running the test locally

The first thing you'll need to do is activate your virtual environment:

> `. /path_to_galaxy_on_your_machine/.venv/bin/activate`

To run the client tests locally, you must be in the client directory; if you're just in the galaxy directory, `cd client` should take you to the right place.

Next, type `yarn run test` or `yarn jest` to run all the client tests.

The output should match what you found on Github. 

### Finding and Fixing the Issue

Next up, finding the error. Here are some tips:
 - Take a look at the failing test and the imports to find out which Vue component the test correlates to. 
 - Look at the test to see what it does. Is there an error in the test?
 - Look at the Vue component where the failure seems to be taking place. Is the error located there?

 The solution is hidden below, but try your hand at fixing it first:

> ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>
> The failure is only happening on the disabled test case, so take a look in the template of `SavedRuleSelector` where the conditions for adding disabled are defined.  
The way it's worded in the test (and the way one could think about it logically), is that if there is no history, the button should be disabled, but the code says `:class="{ disabled: numOfSavedRules == 1 }"` -- whoops!  A very silly off by one error. On that very same line, change the 1 to a 0, and run the test again. {: .solution }

If you think you've got it, try running the test locally again to be sure.

> ### {% icon comment %} Running fewer client tests
>
> If you don't want to run the whole suite of client tests, you can add keywords that match the test path/name.  For example both `yarn run jest rule` and `yarn jest selector` will work, but the former will run other tests with rule in the path/module name.

### Finishing up

Nice Job! If you're here, you've found the problem, ran it locally, fixed the problem, ran it locally again without errors, and are ready to commit your change. Write a descriptive commit message like `fixed a logic error in SavedRuleSelector` or whatever you like, as long as it's clear what you've done.

Awesome work - you now understand how to solve client linting issues!- you now have a handle on client tests!

## Selenium Test Failure

Selenium tests can be difficult to fix, since they cover an expanse of code, but I'm sure you can do it.
TODO definition/purpose of tests?

### Finding the failing test on GitHub

One of the failing tests on GitHub says TODO (check text >) "Selenium Test (3.1, 3.0? --- what does this even mean?)". Feel free to click on that to see a log of all the tests.

Try to identify which test is failing based on the logs.
