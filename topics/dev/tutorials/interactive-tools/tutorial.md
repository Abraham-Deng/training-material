Notes:

Recommendations for version numbering?

There are 2 Docker repositories:
https://github.com/abretaud/geoc_gxit_ansible/
hub.docker.com and http://quay.io/

Container dependancies on Galaxy:
https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/special_topics/mulled_containers.html

The default port of dockerized RShiny app is 3838

The environment_variables would be needed to retrieve data from Galaxy History. In the example, this is therefore not necessary.

# Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates how to build and deploy a Galaxy Interactive Tool (GxIT). GxITs are accessible through the Galaxy tool panel, like any installed Galaxy tool. Our example application is an R Shiny app named `Geoc`.

There are two main elements to a GxIT - a Docker container and a Galaxy tool XML file. This tutorial will take you through creating both components, and installing them into an existing Galaxy instance as a new interactive tool.

> ## {% icon warning %} Requirements for this tutorial
> The Galaxy server requires specialised configuration in order to run interactive tools! Please refer to [this admin tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/interactive-tools/tutorial.html) for setting up a compatible development server for testing your GxIT.
> As well as updating the Galaxy server configuration, you will also have to configure the server's DNS provider to allow wildcard DNS records. This allows Galaxy to create unique subdomains for GxITs to be served over, separating them from the main Galaxy application.
{: .warning}


## How do interactive tools work?

Interactive tools are a special breed of Galaxy tool which is relatively
new to the Galaxy ecosystem - they are a work in progress!
GxITs enable the user to run an entire web application through Galaxy, which
opens as a new tab in the browser. This can enable users to explore and manipulate
data in a rich interface, such as Jupyter notebooks and RStudio. To see some
examples of GxITs in action, take a look at
[Galaxy EU "Live"](https://live.usegalaxy.eu/).


Interactive tool development builds on the canonical tool-wrapping process.
Instead of running a command, the tool feeds user input to a Docker container
running the applcation. Once it's up and running, the GxIT application can
then be accessed through a unique URL generated by the Galaxy server.
The user can then open the application, interact with their Galaxy data and
then terminate the tool. On termination, the Docker container is stopped and
removed, and the job is considered "complete".


## When is an interactive tool appropriate?

In a regular Galaxy tool the user passes data to the tool and waits for it to
run. They then get an output file(s) when the tool run is complete. In an
interactive tool, however, the user is provided with a graphical web interface
allowing them to interact with their data in limitless ways. This is great for
visualising data in real-time, but if it is possible to provide the same
functionality with a regular tool (e.g. by rendering an HTML file as an output)
then an interactive tool might not be necessary. If you are sure that a static
output is not sufficient, then it's time to start building your first
interactive tool!

> ### {% icon comment %} Interactive tool infrastructure
> Interactive tools require some rather complex infrastructure in order to work! However, most of the infrastructure requirements are taken care of by Galaxy core. As such, wrapping a new GxIT requires only two components:
> - Docker container image
> - Galaxy tool XML
>
> However, testing and deploying a GxIT is not so simple. Currently, they are not supported by the Galaxy toolshed and have to be installed and tested manually! This means that distributed GxITs can be found in the Galaxy core codebase, where they can be manually installed by an administrator.

# The development process

Since the infrastructure for building GxITs is not as well developed as regular
tool wrapping, the development process is unfortunately not so streamlined.
Where Planemo is typically used for tool linting and testing, the complex
architecture of GxITs requires a development server to be built to manually
test and run the tool. However, the build process itself is not too complex!
We can break it down into just a few steps:

1. Find or create a Docker image
2. Write a Galaxy tool XML to pass user input to the Docker container
3. Add the tool XML to your Galaxy server
4. Try out the tool in the Galaxy interface. Error messages will appear in the Galaxy history.
5. Revise the container or tool XML, and try again until the application is working.

The last step is likely where the most time is spent - the process requires
iterative development of the Docker image and tool XML until they work together.
As such, reducing the iteration time is the key to quick development! Throughout
the tutorial, we'll sprinkle in some tips on how to speed up the development
cycle.

> ### {% icon comment %} A note on architecture
> When building a GxIT, it is best to keep as much logic as possible in the tool XML, while keeping the Docker image as generic as possible. Why? Updating the tool XML is simple for Galaxy admins and developers in the future. They can view the tool XML directly on the server and understand how the tool works. The Docker image, meanwhile, is relatively opaque to other developers and administrators. To understand the container they must locate the original Dockerfile, which is not always available. Updating the container is more complex, as we will see later. Additionally, keeping the Docker container generic makes it testable outside of Galaxy.
>
> In short: updating the Docker container is hard, but updating the tool XML is easy!

> ### {% icon tip %} A brief primer on Docker
> Docker allows an entire application context to be containerized. A typical web application consists of an operating system, installed dependancies, web server configuration, database configuration and of course the codebase of the software itself. A Docker container can encapsulate all of these components in a single "image", which can be run on any machine with Docker installed.
>
> **Essentials of Docker:**
>
> 1. Write a container recipe as a Dockerfile. This single file selects an OS, installs software, pulls code repositories and copies files from the host machine (your computer).
> 2. Build the container image from your recipe:
>
>    `sudo docker build -t <container_name> .`
> 3. View existing containers with
>
>    `sudo docker image list`.
> 4. Run a container with a specified command:
>
>    `sudo docker run <container_name> <command>`
> 5. Stop a running container:
>
>    `sudo docker stop <container_name>`
> 6. View running containers:
>
>    `sudo docker ps`
> 7. Remove a stopped container:
>
>    `sudo docker container rm <container_name>`
> 8. Remove a container image:
>
>    `sudo docker image rm <container_name>`

# The application

The application that we will wrap in this tutorial is a simple web tool which
allows the user to upload and manipulate `csv` and `tsv` files.

## The Dockerfile

First, let's check out
[the Dockerfile](https://github.com/Lain-inrae/geoc-gxit/dockerfile)
that we'll use to containerize our application.

This container recipe can be used to build a Docker image which can be pushed to a
container registry in the cloud, ready for consumption by our Galaxy instance:

```dockerfile
# build on an existing container
FROM debian:testing

# set author
MAINTAINER Lain Pavot <lain.pavot@inra.fr>

# set encoding
ENV LANG en_US.UTF-8

# we copy the installer and run it before copying the entire project to prevent
# reinstalling everything each time the project has changed. This is optional
# but speeds up the build time.

COPY ./gxit/install.R /tmp/

ENV LC_ALL en_US.UTF-8
ENV LANG en_US.UTF-8
ENV R_BASE_VERSION 4.0.3

# install required libraries

This image is already hosted on Docker Hub at
[TODO:DOCKER_HUB_REPO_LINK](https://hub.docker.com/)
, but anyone can use this Dockerfile to rebuild the image if necessary.

If you are lucky, you might find an available Docker image for the application you are trying to wrap. However, existing Docker images often require some "tweaking" before they will work as a GxIT. Some example configuration changes are:

1. Exposing the correct port. The application, Docker and tool XML ports must be aligned!
2. Logging output to an external file - useful for debugging.
3. Make the application callable from tool `<command>` - this sometimes requires a wrapper script to interface the application inside the container (we'll take a look at this later).

You should now have a container in the cloud, ready for action.
Check out your repo on Docker Hub and you should find the container image there.
Awesome!

Now we just need to write a tool XML that will enable Galaxy to pull and run
our new Docker container as a Galaxy tool.

## The tool XML

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on

> Create a Galaxy tool XML file named `interactivetool_geoc.xml`. The file is similar to a regular tool XML, but calls on our remote Docker image as a dependancy. The tags that we are most concerned with are:

# Installing in Galaxy

We now have all the required components, we can install the tool in our
[configured Galaxy instance](#introduction).
This is as simple as dropping the tool XML in the right location inside
the Galaxy core application directory, and adding the tool to our
`tool_conf_interactive.xml` file.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on
>
> ## Add the tool XML
>
> SSH into your Galaxy instance and take a look at the Galaxy application directory on to see the existing interactive tools:
> ```sh
> # Drop into the Galaxy application directory
> cd /srv/galaxy/server/
>
> # Show the existing GxIT tool files
> ls -l tools/interactive
> ```
>
> Now we can simply create our tools XML here by writing it with `nano`
>
> ```sh
> # Open a new file for editing
> sudo nano tools/interactive/interactivetool_geoc.xml
>
> # >>>  paste the XML content from your code editor and save the file
> ```
>
> ## Enable the new tool
>
>  This step is the same as activating any other existing interactive tool. See [the admin tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/interactive-tools/tutorial.html) for detailed instructions.
>
> ```sh
> # Open the interactive tools config file for editing:
> sudo nano /srv/galaxy/config/tool_conf_interactive.xml
> ```
>
> This configuration file should have been created when
> [administering the Galaxy instance to serve interactive tools](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/interactive-tools/tutorial.html)
> We just need to add a single line to this file to enable our tool. Can you figure it out?
>
> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
> > ```xml
> > <toolbox monitor="true">
> >     <section id="interactivetools" name="Interactive Tools">
> >         <tool file="interactive/interactivetool_geoc.xml" />
> >     </section>
> > </toolbox>
> > ```
> {: .solution}
>
> Now we just need to restart the Galaxy server to refresh the tool registry
>
> ```sh
> sudo service galaxy restart
> ```
>

{: .hands_on}

Have a look in the web interface of your Galaxy instance. You should find the new tool under the "Interactive tools" section in the tool panel. If so, we are ready to start testing it out!


> ### {% icon tip %} Tip: distributing a new GxIT
>
> To release a GxIT for production use, we must distribute two components:
> - the Galaxy tool XML
> - the Docker image
>
> We have already pushed the Docker image to the cloud (thought it should be hosted on an [approved registry](#push-the-container) for production use).
>
> All that's left is to distribute the tool XML. This would conventionally be done through a toolshed. But toolsheds don't support GxITs yet! This leaves us only two options for distributing the tool XML:
> - Make a pull request against [Galaxy core](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy) to include the XML file under `tools/interactive/`
> - Deploy the tool to specific Galaxy instance(s) in an Ansible Playbook

# Debugging

The most obvious way to test a tool is simply to run it in the Galaxy UI, straight from the tool panel. If you are extremely lucky, you will find that the tool starts up and runs without error. But we all know that never happens! So this is where we start iteratively debugging our tool, until it functions as expected.

> ### {% icon comment %} A successful tool run
> It is worth pointing out that the appearance of a GxIT in the Galaxy user history is not intuitive when you are used to running "regular" tool jobs. When the history item turns orange ("processing"), that's when the tool is actually ready to use! At this point, the user interface should refresh and display a link to the active GxIT. Remember, the history item doesn't turn green until a job has terminated. With a GxIT, that only happens when the tool has been stopped by the user, or by wall time limits imposed by the Galaxy administrators.

> ### {% icon tip %} GxIT testing infrastructure
> Testing and debugging is currently the trickiest part of GxIT development. Ideally, Galaxy core will be developed in the future to better support the process, but for the time being we have to make the most with what is available! In the future, we would like to see GxITs being tested with Planemo, and being installed and tested by Ephemeris from the toolshed.

# Additional components
Some extra complexity that comes up GxIT development - not necessary for all GxITs

## Self-destruct script
To watch container HTTP traffic and kill the container process when the connection to Galaxy is lost.

## Run script
A nice interface for the application within the container that our tool XML can call easily.

## Templated config files
Using the `<configfiles>` section in the tool XML, we can enable complex user configuration for the applcation by templating a run script or configuration file to be read by the application.
