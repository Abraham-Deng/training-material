# What is Dockstore?

## Why use Dockstore?

Dockstore follows the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).

## Findable

- Dockstore parses provided metadata and allows it to be searchable.

- With the faceted search feature, user can find workflows using search terms and filter using workflow language, author, organization, labels, etc.

- Institutions and organizations can showcase their work by research theme in the Organizations and Collections page. For example, [IWCG](https://dockstore.org/organizations/iwc)

## Why use Dockstore?

Dockstore follows the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).

## Accessible

- Dockstore never requires a user to log in to search and inspect contents for workflows and tools.

- Once found, analyses can be launched in different environments using the Launch with feature of Dockstore. Workflows can just as easily be downloaded to run on local machines.

- Users can also request a DOI via Zenodo for their workflows for reference in published research.

## Why use Dockstore?

Dockstore follows the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).

## Interoperable

- Users are strongly encouraged to provide clear instructions, test data and checker workflows to ensure that their workflows are usable in any environment.

- The GA4GH TRS API enable the simple launching of workflows to a variety of compute platforms.

## Why use Dockstore?

Dockstore follows the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).

## Reusable

- Contributors are encouraged to provide clear documentation and the exact version of the components in their descriptor files so that others can find, reuse and build upon the workflows.

- The Dockstore GitHub App provides support for registering workflows, version control/tagging and automatically syncing workflows and services.
