Pangeo is first and foremost a community promoting open, reproducible, and scalable science.
This community provides documentation, develops and maintains software, and deploys computing infrastructure to make scientific research and programming easier.
The Pangeo software ecosystem involves open source tools such as xarray, iris, dask, jupyter, and many other packages. There is no single software package called pangeo; rather, the Pangeo project serves as a coordination point between scientists, software, and computing infrastructure.

## Motivations

There are several building crises facing the geoscience community:

.left[- *Big Data*: datasets are growing too rapidly and legacy software tools for scientific analysis canâ€™t handle them. This is a major obstacle to scientific progress.]
.left[- *Technology Gap*: a growing gap between the technological sophistication of industry solutions (high) and scientific software (low).]
.left[- *Reproducibility*: a fragmentation of software tools and environments renders most geoscience research effectively unreproducible and prone to failure.]

## Goals

Pangeo aims to address these challenges through a unified, collaborative effort.

*The mission of Pangeo is to cultivate an ecosystem in which the next generation of open-source analysis tools for ocean, atmosphere 
and climate science can be developed, distributed, and sustained. These tools must be scalable in order to meet the current and future 
challenges of big data, and these solutions should leverage the existing expertise outside of the geoscience community.*

## Pangeo Galaxy Tools

**A growing number of tools available to non Python programmers**

.left[Xarray Galaxy tools:

- Manipulate netCDF with Zarr e.g. Cloud Optimized Data available soon;
- Visualize geographical ([CF-Convention](https://cfconventions.org/)) netCDF on a map;
- "Convert" to tabular data to increase interoperability with other Galaxy Tools;
- **Graphical User Interface**: learn about the concepts without being hindered by Python programming.]

*Our objective is to bridge the gap between disciplines and add tools on demand to help cross-disciplinary research*

## How to cite and support Pangeo

- Cite Pangeo when using Xarray Galaxy Tools:
    -  {% cite Abernathey2017 %}, {% cite Abernathey2021 %}, {% cite Gentemann2021 %} and {% cite Sambasivan2021 %}
- Report issues, wishes and thank the Pangeo Community whenever you use tools from the Pangeo software stack!
