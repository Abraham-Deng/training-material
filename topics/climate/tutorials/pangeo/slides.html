## What is Pangeo?

???

Pangeo is first and foremost a community promoting open, reproducible, and scalable science.
This community provides documentation, develops and maintains software, and deploys computing infrastructure to make scientific research and programming easier.
The Pangeo software ecosystem involves open source tools such as xarray, iris, dask, jupyter, and many other packages. There is no single software package called pangeo; rather, the Pangeo project serves as a coordination point between scientists, software, and computing infrastructure.
