Pangeo is first and foremost a community promoting open, reproducible, and scalable science.
This community provides documentation, develops and maintains software, and deploys computing infrastructure to make scientific research and programming easier.
The Pangeo software ecosystem involves open source tools such as xarray, iris, dask, jupyter, and many other packages. There is no single software package called pangeo; rather, the Pangeo project serves as a coordination point between scientists, software, and computing infrastructure.

---

## Motivations

.left[ There are several building crises facing the geoscience community: ]

.left[- *Big Data*: datasets are growing too rapidly and legacy software tools for scientific analysis canâ€™t handle them. This is a major obstacle to scientific progress.]
.left[- *Technology Gap*: a growing gap between the technological sophistication of industry solutions (high) and scientific software (low).]
.left[- *Reproducibility*: a fragmentation of software tools and environments renders most geoscience research effectively unreproducible and prone to failure.]

---

## Goals

Pangeo aims to address these challenges through a unified, collaborative effort.

*The mission of Pangeo is to cultivate an ecosystem in which the next generation of open-source analysis tools for ocean, atmosphere 
and climate science can be developed, distributed, and sustained. These tools must be scalable in order to meet the current and future 
challenges of big data, and these solutions should leverage the existing expertise outside of the geoscience community.*

## Xarray 

*Xarray is an open source project and Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient, and fun!*

<img src="../../images/dataset-diagram-logo.png" alt="Xarray logo" width="400"/>


???


---

## What is Xarray?


.left[Xarray expands on NumPy arrays and pandas. Xarray has two core data structures:]

.left[- `DataArray` is our implementation of a labeled, N-dimensional array. It is an N-D generalization of a `pandas.Series`.]
.left[- `Dataset` is a multi-dimensional, in-memory array database. It is a dict-like container of `DataArray` objects aligned along any number of shared dimensions, and serves a similar purpose in xarray to the `pandas.DataFrame`.]

## Pangeo Cloud Data Catalog

Pangeo maintains an experimental catalog of analysis-ready cloud-based data at [catalog.pangeo.io](https://catalog.pangeo.io/).

Pangeo project is actively researching different approaches to storing and cataloging data in the cloud. Some important technologies currently in use include

- [Spatiotemporal Asset Catalog](https://stacspec.org/): A common language to describe a range of geospatial information, so it can more easily be indexed and discovered.
- [Intake](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): A python package for finding, investigating, loading and disseminating data.

## Analysis Ready, Cloud Optimized Data (ARCO)

- What is "Analysis Ready"?
  - Think in "Datasets" not "data files"
  - No need for tedious homogenizing / cleaning setup_guides
  - Curated and cataloged

- What is "Cloud Optimized"?
  - Compatible with object storage e.g. access via HTTP
  - Supports lazy access and intelligent subsetting
  - Integrates with high-level analysis libraries and distributed frameworks

## Pangeo Forge

<img src="https://pangeo-forge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/pangeo-forge-logo-blue.png" alt="Pangeo Forge Logo" width="400">

[https://pangeo-forge.org](https://pangeo-forge.org)

Pangeo Forge is an open source platform for data **Extraction**, **Transformation**, and **Loading** (ETL).
The goal of *Pangeo Forge* is to make it easy to extract data from traditional data repositories and deposit in cloud
object storage in analysis-ready, cloud optimized (ARCO) format.

Pangeo Forge is inspired directly by Conda Forge, a community-led collection of recipes for building conda packages.

## STAC

.center[STAC stands for **SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog**.]

---

## Why STAC?

*Each provider has its <span style="color:green">catalog and interface</span>*.

.pull-left[

Just searching the relevant data for your project could be a tough work...

- **Lot of data providers â€¦**
- **Each interface is unique â€¦**

]

.pull-right[ ![Why STAC](../../images/why_STAC.png) ]

---

## Why STAC?

*Each provider has its own <span style="color:green">Application Programming Interface (API)</span>*.

.pull-left[

If you are a programmer thatâ€™s exactly the same...

You should design a new data connector each time...

- **Lot of data providers â€¦**
- **Each API is unique â€¦**

## Why STAC?

*Let's work <span style="color:green">together</span>*.

.pull-left[

The main purpose of STAC is:

- **Build an commun language to catalog geospatial data**

]

.pull-right[ ![STAC](../../images/STAC-logo.png) ]

---

## Why STAC?

*Let's work <span style="color:green">together</span>*.

.pull-left[

Itâ€™s extremely simple, STAC catalogs are composed of three layers :  

- **Catalogs**
    - **Collections**
        - **Items**

## STAC and Pangeo Forge

- Pangeo-forge supports the creation of analysis-ready cloud optimized (ARCO) data in cloud object storage from "classical" data repositories;
- STAC is used to create catalog and goes beyond the Pangeo ecosystem;
- It is important for Pangeo to use STAC and make sure data generated with Pangeo-forge are correctly "referenced" in STAC.
