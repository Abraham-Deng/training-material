# History

## 2015

@hexylena, @bgruening, and @jmchilton create Galaxy Interactive Environments (GIEs)

GIEs use Galaxy's *visualization framework* to run certain types of *interactive* visualizations (e.g. Jupyter Notebook)

GIEs run in a docker container on the Galaxy server or a single remote Docker server

???

 - GIEs are a type of visualization in Galaxy
 - Accessible through the “Visualize” menu or under visualization button on a dataset with specific datatypes
 - More details within GIEs slides (https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/tutorials/interactive-environments/slides.html#8)
 - Back then, the docker container serving a GIE could not be run on a cluster

---
# History

## 2016

Support for Docker Swarm is added, allowing running a cluster for GIEs

???

 - Docker integrates natively the swarm mode for cluster management and orchestration features for Docker Engine, allowing us to run GIEs on a cluster

---
# History

## 2019

@blankenberg creates Galaxy Interactive Tools (GxITs)

Building on the GIE concept, but run as *tools*

Tools run just as any other Galaxy job (e.g. via Slurm, HTCondor)

You will sometimes see Interactive Tools referred to as Interactive Environments version 2

???

 - Like GIEs, GxITs are built on docker containers and are accessible through Galaxy interface
 - But they are considered as tools, launchable from the toolbox menu, on a predefined destination and prioritized as any other job

# Tool config syntax

```xml
<tool id="interactive_tool_jupyter_notebook" tool_type="interactive" name="Interactive Jupyter Notebook" version="0.1">
    <requirements>
        <container type="docker">quay.io/bgruening/docker-jupyter-notebook:ie2</container>
    </requirements>
    <entry_points>
        <entry_point name="Jupyter Interactive Tool" requires_domain="True">
            <port>8888</port>
            <url>ipython/lab</url>
        </entry_point>
    </entry_points>
</tool>
```

???

 - To configure an interactive tool’s wrapper
 - Give it a type (tool_type=”interactive”)
 - As requirement, set the path to the repository where the container is to be pulled of
 - Define the tool entry point on the container. For instance, for a Jupyter Notebook, you’ll give the port the application is served on and the domain name suffix

# Mapping clients to containers

- GIEs: Unique path, e.g. `https://galaxy.example.org/gie-proxy/jupyter/...`
  - Pros: Works with existing SSL certificate
  - Cons: Requires Galaxy session cookie (no sharing), can only run one at a time, closing your browser loses your session
- GxITs: Unique hostname, e.g. `https://<unique-id>.interactivetoolentrypoint.interactivetool.galaxy.example.org/`
  - Pros: Needs no special credentials (can be shared)
  - Cons: Requires *wildcard* DNS entry and *wildcard* SSL certificate (not possible at many sites)

???

 - Diverse infrastructures behind GIEs and GxITs, induces various constraints and benefits for GIEs et GxITs, especially when building the path between the browser and the container

# Anatomy of a running Interactive Tool

![Galaxy Interactive Tools Proxy Diagram](../../images/interactive-tools/gxit-proxy-diagram.png "Galaxy Interactive Tools Proxy Diagram")

 - First, remember, when an docker container starts, it will be assigned a host (server or node) and a random port on that host (in our example, port 32768). This information is stored by Galaxy in a sqlite database

 - This slide illustrates the steps allowing a client to interact with a GxIT, in the case of a Galaxy server using a reverse proxy (NGINX) 
 - The client speaks to NGINX on the Galaxy server, running on the standard https port (443)
 - Based on the elements provided by the URL, NGINX redirects requests to Galaxy over a UNIX domain socket as usual
 - On the other hand, HTTP requests for interactive tools are redirected by NGINX, to a proxy (GIE Proxy written in Node.js) running on port 8000. This proxy checks in the sqlite database to know which node and port the IT container is to be found, then forwards the HTTP request to Docker on that node and port. Docker, in turn, forwards it to the application (e.g. Jupyter) on the container’s port (defined in the wrapper) 

---
# Galaxy configuration

Enable docker on a destination in `job_conf.xml` and assign your GxITs to that destination

.left[Set in `galaxy.yml`:]
```yaml
interactivetools_enable: true
interactivetools_map: /srv/galaxy/var/gie-proxy-sessions.sqlite
```

???

 - To get interactive tools running within your Galaxy instance
 - In your galaxy.yml, enable the use of interactive tools then set the path to the sqlite database storing proxying data
 - In the job_conf.xml, give to the tool a destination allowing the use of Docker (more details in the tutorial)

---
# Proxy configuration

Use the uWSGI proxy configuration that ships with Galaxy

Or the [Node.js-based proxy][usegalaxy_eu-gie_proxy]

[usegalaxy_eu-gie_proxy]: https://galaxy.ansible.com/usegalaxy_eu/gie_proxy

???

 - In production, you are likely to use the Nodejs-based proxy set up by the Galaxy admin team 
 - During developement, you can use the uWSGI proxy configuration used by default by Galaxy

---
# Security

The default docker-enabled container exposes all datasets to the tool

Normally this isn't bad (normal tools can't be controlled by the user)

Interactive tools are fully user controllable

Solution: [Embedded Pulsar][job-conf-pulsar-embedded]

[job-conf-pulsar-embedded]: https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/6622ad1acb91866febb3d2f229de7cfb8af3a9f6/lib/galaxy/config/sample/job_conf.xml.sample_advanced#L106

---
# Embedded Pulsar

Runs a [Pulsar][pulsar] server within the Galaxy application to "stage" (i.e. copy) inputs.

- Pros: Inputs in isolated dir so only that dir is mounted in the container: secure
- Cons: Has to copy inputs on each Interactive Tool execution: slow
