title: "Storage Management"
questions:
- How does Galaxy locate data?
- How can I have Galaxy use multiple storage locations?
objectives:
- Setup Galaxy with both the Hierarachical and Distributed Object Storages
key_points:
- The distributed object store configuration allows you to easily expand that storage that is attached to your Galaxy.
- You can move data around without affecting users.

# Data Libraries

Provide a way to conveniently share Galaxy datasets within a group of Galaxy users or with everybody that has access to a specific instance of Galaxy.

* Can import data from filesystem *without duplicating* it.

--
* Can import *whole directories* preserving the folder structure.

--
* The dataset's size does not count towards user's quota.
  * Every dataset in the library is *stored only once* no matter how many users are using it in their histories.

--
* Uses roles and groups to control permissions on library/dataset level.
  * Only admins can _create_ libraries.
  * Ordinary users can be granted permission to _manage_ libraries

# Libraries configuration

In `galaxy.yml`:

* `user_library_import_dir`
  * Allows authorized non-administrators to upload a directory of files.
  * Directory must contain sub-directories named the same as user's email.
  * Works well in combination with `ftp_upload_dir`.
* `allow_path_paste`
  * Admin-only, allows importing from any path that the Galaxy's user has access to.

???
If you use old library interface you can also set `library_import_dir`.
It specifies which folder admins may browse and import from.
