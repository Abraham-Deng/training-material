There are many more extensions out there so dont be scared to go some shopping for features you would look handy.
For example there are also features which makes writing in markdown easier or even spellcheck it for you.<br><br><br>

## Overview of VCS

Visual code study contains alot of awesome features but can be quite overwhelming in the start. Luckly we already installed some extensions for quality of life.
But now is the real work.

- Explorer. In this  tab are all files of the current github repository. This is currently still empty. but not for long!
- Search, a search function for in your github repository
- Source controll. If you edited and saved a file from a github, is here your change to make an pull request or to commit it directly
.<br> pull request = sending the owner a nice message about what you would like to change
- run and debug, is for running files, for exammple hello_world.py
- extensions, a place where you can go shopping for new plugins
- Remote exporer. an overview of previous githubs where you have been
- github, here is the real magic. Every github repository you own or are admin for will be sended to this. when a person makes a pull or fork request you will get an automated message here. 

On the top bar of VCS are various functions. Files to generate files. Edit to easily edits files. It also possible to openup an terminal and run various codes

On the bottom of the windo is the workspace and branch you are working in.

but enough talking, lets get into some action<br><br><br>



## Getting access to a github repository

Remember the repository you made. lets open it up.
click on the green box in the left under box ![image](images/github_knopje.png).

This will open a small terminal above and click on "open remote repository".

 In this window you fill in the URL of the github repository you created earlier.

Every time you have added a github repository. you dont have to search the url again. when clicking the remote repository you will find a overview off all repository you have worked in. you also see if you need to update a repository locally in VCS.
