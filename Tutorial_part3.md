There are many more extensions out there so dont be scared to go some shopping for features you would look handy.
For example there are also features which makes writing in markdown easier or even spellcheck it for you.

### Overview of VCS

Visual code study contains alot of awesome features but can be quite overwhelming in the start. Luckly we already installed some extensions for quality of life.
But now is the real work.

- Explorer. In this  tab are all files of the current github repository. This is currently still empty. but not for long!
